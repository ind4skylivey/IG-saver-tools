## 📊 Decision Points

### Desktop Framework Decision
**Target Decision Date:** December 2025

We're evaluating:

| Framework | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Electron** | Mature, large ecosystem, easy React integration | Large bundle size (~150MB) |
| **Tauri** | Small size (~10MB), Rust security, modern | Younger ecosystem, steeper learning curve |
| **PyQt/PySide** | Native Python, small size | Less modern UI, harder to theme |
